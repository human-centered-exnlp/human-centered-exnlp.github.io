<!-- ## Tables
* [Table SM1](table1.html): A categorization of work trying to find linguistic information in neural networks according to the neural network component investigated, the linguistic property sought, and the analysis method. See Section 2 in the paper.
* [Table SM2](table2.html): A categorization of challenge sets for evaluating neural networks according to the NLP task, the linguistic phenomena, the represented languages, the dataset size, and the construction method. See Section 4 in the paper.
* [Table SM3](table3.html): A categorization of methods for adversarial examples in NLP according to adversary's knowledge (white-box vs. black-box), attack specificity (targeted vs. non-targeted), the modified linguistic unit (words, characters, etc.), and the attacked task. See Section 5 in the paper.
