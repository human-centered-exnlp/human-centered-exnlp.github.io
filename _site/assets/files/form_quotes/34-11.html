Description: "Interpretation by Example. We can explain a prediction on a
test example by finding the most influential training examples.
Various metrics exist for finding important training examples, such
as distance in the representation space which is natural to linear
models, clustering algorithms and their deep variation [49], and
influence functions [33] for non-linear models."
