Description: "Top 3 concepts generated using ESA for two
20-newsgroups categories (Hockey and Guns) along with top 3 concepts of sample instances. Using exact match similarity scoring (as in ESA) result in low
scores between similar instance and category concept vectors. When using concept embeddings (our models), we obtain relatively higher and more representative
similarities."
