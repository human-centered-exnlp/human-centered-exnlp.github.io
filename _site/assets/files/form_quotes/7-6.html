Description: " testing whether a neural network embeds each sentence’s dependency parse tree in its contextual word representations – a structural hypothesis.
"Under a reasonable definition, to embed a graph is to learn a vector representation of each node such that geometry in the vector space—distances and norms—
approximates geometry in the graph"
