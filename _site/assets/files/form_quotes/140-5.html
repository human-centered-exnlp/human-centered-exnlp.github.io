Description: 
" A visualization of layerwise patterns in task
performance. Each column represents a probing task, and each row represents a contextualizer layer."
"To shed light on the linguistic knowledge they capture, we study the representations produced by several recent pretrained contextualizers (variants
of ELMo, the OpenAI transformer language
model, and BERT) with a suite of seventeen
diverse probing tasks"
