Description: " we define multigranular ngrams as basic units for explanation,
and organize all ngrams into a hierarchical
structure, so that shorter ngrams can be reused
while computing longer ngrams. We leverage a tree-structured LSTM to learn a contextindependent representation for each unit via
parameter sharing."
