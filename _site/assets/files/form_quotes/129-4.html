Description: " Examples of the corresponded rationales for QA. Words highlighted in the same color
from the question and a passage is a paired rationale. “Galileo Galilei” is the correct answer since
two facts from the question are matched in its passage. On the other hand, the passage of “Isaac
Newton” does not cover the second fact, which makes it a wrong answer."
