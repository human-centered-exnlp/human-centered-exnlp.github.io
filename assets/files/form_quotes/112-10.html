Description: "Due to the fact that we use mean-pooling, our approach may lend itself to interpretations of the bias in a model on average
across contexts."

"While these works have provided nuanced finegrained analyses by creating new interpretability schema/techniques, we instead take an alternate approach of trying to re-purpose methods developed
for analyzing static word embeddings."
