Description:  ”The central idea of this paper is to use informative priors to restrict the degree to which different
words can inhabit different dimensions, such that
one or more dimensions become interpretable and
connected to one’s research interest. Specifically,
we place informative priors on word types that we
expect to discriminate on a particular dimension,
e.g. man-woman for a gender dimension.“
