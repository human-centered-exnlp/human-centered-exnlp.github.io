Description: "Overview of Multimodal Routing, which contains encoding, routing, and prediction stages. We consider only two input modalities in this example. The encoding stage computes unimodal and bimodal explanatory features with the inputs from different modalities. The routing stage iteratively performs concepts update and routing adjustment. The prediction stage decodes the concepts to the modelâ€™s prediction."
