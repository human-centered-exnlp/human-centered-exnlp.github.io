Description: "May et al. adopt the WEAT tests [5] into Sentence Encoder Association Tests (SEATs) to test biases
using sentence encodings. The embeddings used in the association tests are encodings of a sentence,
which are obtained by pooling per token contextual representations, or by using the representation
of the first or last token."
