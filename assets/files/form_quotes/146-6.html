Description: "A multi-hop example chosen from the HotpotQA development set. Several documents are given as context to answer a question. We show two possible “reasoning chains” that leverage connections (shared entities or coreference relations) between sentences to arrive at the answer. The first chain is most appropriate, while the second requires a less well-supported inferential leap."
