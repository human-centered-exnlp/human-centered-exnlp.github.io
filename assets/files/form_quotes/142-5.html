Description: "Building on recent token-level probing
work, we introduce a novel edge probing task design and construct a broad suite
of sub-sentence tasks derived from the traditional structured NLP pipeline. We
probe word-level contextual representations from four recent models and investigate how they encode sentence structure across a range of syntactic, semantic,
local, and long-range phenomena. "
