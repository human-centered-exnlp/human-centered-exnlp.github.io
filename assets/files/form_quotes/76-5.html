Description: "Our control tasks define random behavior (like
a random output, top) for each word type in the vocabulary.
Each word token is assigned its typeâ€™s output, regardless of
context (middle, bottom.) Control tasks have the same input
and output space as a linguistic task (e.g., parts-of-speech) but
can only be learned if the probe memorizes the mapping."
