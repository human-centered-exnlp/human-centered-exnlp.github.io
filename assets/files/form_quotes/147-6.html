Description: "Intrinsically human communication is multimodal (heterogeneous), temporal and
asynchronous; it consists of the language (words), visual (expressions), and acoustic
(paralinguistic) modalities all in the form of asynchronous coordinated sequences.
From a resource perspective, there is a genuine need for large scale datasets that allow for in-depth studies of multimodal language"
