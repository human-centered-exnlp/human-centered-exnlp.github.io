Uncertainty Score:
Visualize: Figure 1 / Guesses.
Description: "Conveying Uncertainty. Augmenting the prediction from a neural
network classifier with a confidence score (a value between zero and
one) conveys the uncertainty of the model. In a cooperative setting,
the uncertainty helps humans decide to trust the model or not [3, 57].
To make it more informative, we can also display the confidence for
the classes other than the top one"
