Description: "Model A and B are two neural text classifiers
with similar network architectures. They all make correct sentiment predictions on both texts (ex. 1: positive; ex. 2: negative). Two post-hoc explanation methods, LIME (Ribeiro et al., 2016) and SampleShapley
(Kononenko et al., 2010), are used to explain the model
predictions on example 1 and 2 respectively."
